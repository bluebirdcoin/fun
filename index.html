			<h2>But why BBC?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Because let's be real, traditional investments are boring AF.</li>
				<li>Because investing in BBC is the perfect way to tell Wall Street and the mainstream media to shove it.</li>
				<li>Because BBC is a great hedge against zombie apocalypses and alien invasions.</li>
				<li>Because who doesn't dream about hodling BBC?</li>
				<li>Because a wise man named Elon once said "Penetrating deep & hard with BBC"</li>
				<li>Because BBC will make memes great again.</li>
				<li>And lastly, because you're a trendsetter, not a follower. And hodling BBC is the most on trend move you could make.</li>
